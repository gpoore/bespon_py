What?
=====

BespON is a multi-paradigm, extensible configuration language.

Data may be represented in three forms:

* A compact, inline form similar to `JSON <http://www.json.org/>`_
* An indentation-based form similar to `YAML <http://www.yaml.org/>`_
* A section- and keypath-based form similar to `INI <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file>`_ and `TOML <https://github.com/toml-lang/toml>`_

BespON provides syntax for working with additional data types beyond those defined in the base specification.

A new format requires a solid justification.  What's different compared to existing formats?

* Comments
* No invalid trailing commas or equivalents
* Multiline string literals with simple control of leading whitespace
* Unquoted strings
